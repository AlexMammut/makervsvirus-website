    Using our Maker skills against Corona
  subtitle: |
    This website is intended to bring together people and organisations
    who need currently hard-to-find protective equipment or spare parts
    with makers and makerspaces who can possibly produce them. Behind this
    project is a small German and English speaking organization team.

      The goal is for people to come together in a self-organized way to form (local or international) production
      hubs, which we can list on this website. For this purpose we offer the following Slack workspace to find
      fellow Makers or existing hubs in need of help. If you want to register as a new producing hub,
      please write in the Slack channel called "Register Hub". <strong>Please note: </strong> We only list
      initiatives that offer their (self) produced items for free or at cost price.
